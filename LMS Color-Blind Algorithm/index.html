                This site is a test case designed to verify the effectiveness of the simulator 
                that we designed with the aim of helping those who want to have an experience 
                about what color-blind people see, in addition to the corrector that also aims 
                to enhance the colors of the images so that color-blind people can distinguish 
                between colors.
                <br>
                We wish you a satisfying experience ^^
